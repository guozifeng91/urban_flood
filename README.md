# code
the latest file for portugal is [urban_flood/model_portugal/shuffle_patterns.py (training and testing)](https://github.com/guozifeng91/urban_flood/blob/master/urban_flood/model_portugal/shuffle_patterns.py) and [urban_flood/interact.ipynb (jupyter interactive)](https://github.com/guozifeng91/urban_flood/blob/master/urban_flood/interact.ipynb), which is trained using random patches and 3/4 of the rain patterns. 1/4 of the patterns are test set.


the model for the latest result is [urban_flood/data/model/portugal_shuffle_pattern](https://github.com/guozifeng91/urban_flood/tree/master/urban_flood/data/model/portugal_shuffle_pattern) and the code is [urban_flood/model_portugal/nn_model.py](https://github.com/guozifeng91/urban_flood/blob/master/urban_flood/model_portugal/nn_model.py)

# data
data for luzern and hoengg are in the folder "data/luzern" and "data/hoengg", data for portugal is too large to upload

# result
the latest results are in [urban_flood/data/images](https://github.com/guozifeng91/urban_flood/tree/master/urban_flood/data/images), other folder start with "image" are the results for previous experiments
